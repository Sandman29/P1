<h2>Describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
<p>I live in Tampa, Florida where I work as a Mergers and Acquisitions Advisor.  I sell businesses in what we call "Lower Middle Markets", which are generally businesses between $5 to $50 million dollars in enterprise value.</p>
<h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
<p>The primary reason I am taking this course is to learn how to develop interactive websites.  Also, I am an ALM IT candidate and I am also working towards a Professional Certificate in Web Technologies.</p>
<h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
<p>I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science from 30 years ago. Obviously, at that time there was no public internet, no real object orientated programming.  Back then our education was working in Assembly, LISP, Pascal, PL/1 and a few other technologies mostly on an IBM 360/370 mainframe, a little on an PHP-11 and some board level controller work on an Intel I8080.
</p>
<p>Since, starting in the ALM program at Harvard Extension School, I have taken the following courses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to Computer Science Using Java I</li>
<li>Introduction to Computer Science Using Java II</li>
<li>Data Sructures</li>
<li>Fundamentals of Web Development</li>
<li>Java for Distributed Computing</li>
<li>Web Development Using XML</li>
<li>Computer Security</li>
<li>Database Systems</li>
</ul>
<h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or other platform?</h2>
<p>Desktop Mac.</p>
<h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
<p>I have never programmed a computer professionally, only academically. My first job out of school was as a Semiconductor Sales Engineer with Texas Instruments. I then earn and MBA and became a Financial Advisor with Merrill Lynch. About, nine years ago I became a Mergers and Aquisitions Advisor.</p>
<p>I probably may never program a computer professionally, but I enjoy Computer Science as field of academic study.</p>
